# Mentorskool Community Projects - Welcome!

**Hi There!**

Mentorskool welcomes you all to this exciting new project!

### What's the fuss all about?
* Well, Data Analytics being one of the hottest fields to pursue in the market, there are a plethora of options to learn the tools and techniques required to solve real world challenges out there
* While numerous institutions and individuals have done a commendable job in upskilling many aspirants, learners still feel far less confident when it comes to applying their learnt skills
* This is one of our hand picked projects to help individuals apply all their learning in an environment which supports innovation, error and repetitions
* You start with one and slowly pick up more projects as you grow in confidence
* You start as a learner, mature to a contributor and finally become an authority of the project!

* You learn the obvious skills including : 
	* learning to **code**
	* learning the **math** behind data analysis
	* learning to **visualize**
	* learning to work with **messy data**

* You learn skills which are mostly ignored BUT are highly critical in a real world project : 
	* learning about **code versioning**
	* learning about **problem breakdown**
	* asking the **right questions**
	* developing the **right KPIs and Hypotheses**
	* learning to **wireframe** your solutions!
